# Development-of-ApptBook-ADT-for-Appointment-Management
• Implemented the ApptBook ADT as a series of appointments, building on previously developed ADTs.
• Created the Appointment ADT to depict a calendar entry, featuring a time period and a description of the activity.
• Ensured the immutability of the Appointment ADT and added comparison methods to sort appointments.
• Developed the ApptBook ADT as a variant of the Sequence ADT, organizing appointments sequentially and adding a new setCurrent method.
• Modified Sequence ADT methods with tailored changes, such as using insert instead of addBefore and addAfter, and excluded null values in appointments to avoid issues in the compareTo method.
• Implemented invariants and assertions to uphold the integrity of the ApptBook ADT and confirm its proper state.
• Adhered to coding best practices, opting for "for" loops over System.arrayCopy for enhanced clarity.
• Conducted JUnit testing (TestApptBook.java) to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the ADT.
• Committed changes frequently to document progress and maintain version control.
